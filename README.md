## 🎯 About The Project

When working with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, providing the entire context of a software project is often necessary but cumbersome. Manually opening files, copying their content, and cleaning them up is time-consuming and inefficient.

This tool automates that entire process. It provides a clean, ChatGPT-like interface where you can upload a project folder. The application then:
1.  Recursively reads all text-based files within the folder.
2.  Cleans the content by removing unnecessary whitespace and empty lines to reduce token count.
3.  Combines the structured content into a single block, with file paths as headers.
4.  Automatically copies the final, optimized result to your clipboard.

All processing happens client-side in your browser, ensuring your code remains private and secure.
